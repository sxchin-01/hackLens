# HackerBuddy Changelog

## April 2026 - Backend AI Simulation & Observability Update

### Backend additions
- Added stateful simulation loop engine at `lib/ai/simulation-engine.ts` with `runSimulationStep(state, action, context)`.
- Added attacker progression and system-state termination support (`secured`, `fully_compromised`, `exfiltration`).
- Added adaptive scoring updates for simulation outcomes with bounded score handling.

### API/service architecture updates
- Added service-layer routes and handlers for analysis, scenario generation, analytics, and user tracking.
- Added backend service modules for analysis, scenario orchestration, and user/stat operations.
- Added schema validation modules for analysis and scenario payloads.

### Logging and runtime hygiene
- Introduced structured logger module with helper methods for API/service/AI events.
- Added environment-driven log level control via `LOG_LEVEL` (`info`, `warn`, `error`).
- Suppressed logger output during tests to reduce noise and improve test readability.
- Added coverage ignore rules to keep generated artifacts out of version control.

### Test coverage expansion
- Added dedicated Vitest suites for:
   - LLM client behavior and fallback paths
   - Adaptive engine logic
   - User tracking behavior
   - Service-layer logic
   - API route behavior
- Test suite remains green after backend changes.

### Documentation updates
- README now includes backend architecture, simulation engine, logging controls, and updated project structure.
- Quick reference updated with backend API and environment configuration notes.
